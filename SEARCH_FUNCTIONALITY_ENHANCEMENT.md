# Enhanced Search Functionality for Former Curriculum Selection

## Overview
This document describes the enhanced search functionality implemented for the student selection dropdown in the Former Zambian Curriculum Subject Selection component.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Secondary School Filtering**
- **Automatic Filtering**: Only shows students in secondary school (grades 7-12)
- **Grade Level Validation**: Ensures students are in appropriate grades for curriculum assignment
- **Dynamic Count Display**: Shows the number of available secondary students

### 2. **Advanced Search Capabilities**
- **Multi-field Search**: Search by student name, grade, or student number
- **Partial Matching**: Supports partial text matching across all searchable fields
- **Multi-term Search**: Can search for multiple terms (e.g., "John Grade 9")
- **Case-insensitive**: Search is not case-sensitive for better user experience

### 3. **Enhanced User Interface**
- **Clear Placeholder Text**: "Search by name, grade, or student number..."
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows count of available students
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during data fetch
- **Error Handling**: Clear messages when no students are found

### 4. **Custom Filter Function**
```javascript
const customStudentFilter = (value, filter) => {
  if (!filter) return true;
  
  const searchTerm = filter.toLowerCase().trim();
  if (!searchTerm) return true;
  
  // Search in multiple fields: name, grade, student number
  const student = value;
  const searchableText = `${student.fullName || ''} ${student.grade?.name || ''} ${student.studentNumber || ''}`.toLowerCase();
  
  // Split search term to allow partial matches across different fields
  const searchTerms = searchTerm.split(' ').filter(term => term.length > 0);
  
  // All search terms must be found somewhere in the searchable text
  return searchTerms.every(term => searchableText.includes(term));
};
```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. **Student Data Processing**
```javascript
const filteredStudents = computed(() => {
  return students.value
    .filter(student => {
      // Only secondary school students (grades 7-12)
      return student.grade && student.grade.level >= 7 && student.grade.level <= 12;
    })
    .map(student => ({
      ...student,
      displayName: `${student.fullName} (${student.grade?.name || 'No Grade'})`,
      searchText: `${student.fullName} ${student.grade?.name || ''} ${student.studentNumber || ''}`.toLowerCase()
    }));
});
```

### 2. **Enhanced Select Component**
```vue
<Select 
  id="studentSelect"
  v-model="selectedStudent" 
  :options="filteredStudents" 
  optionLabel="displayName" 
  optionValue="id"
  :placeholder="filteredStudents.length === 0 ? 'No secondary students found' : 'Choose a student'"
  class="w-full"
  :loading="loadingStudents"
  @change="onStudentChange"
  :filter="true"
  filterPlaceholder="Search by name, grade, or student number..."
  :showClear="true"
  :disabled="filteredStudents.length === 0"
  :filterFunction="customStudentFilter"
  :virtualScrollerOptions="{ itemSize: 38 }"
/>
```

### 3. **User Feedback System**
- **Success Messages**: Confirms when students are loaded successfully
- **Warning Messages**: Alerts when no secondary students are found
- **Info Display**: Shows count and search instructions
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during data operations
